# Control-an-RC-Car-with-WiFi-Using-ARM32-ESP32
Control an RC Car over WiFi using an ESP32 module and STM32 (ARM Cortex-M4). ESP32 receives commands via a web interface and sends them to STM32 through UART. STM32 processes the commands to control the car's motors and steering for real-time wireless control.
